			<h2>Why Am I Here?</h2>
			<p>Well, that's a great question, to be honest. <br> I definitely didn't think writing code
				and testing it 100 times before it finally worked the way I wanted- was gonna be what I do for a living.<br>
				Yet, here I am. Loving every second of it.</p>
			<h2>Why Are You Here?</h2>
			<p>Wild guess- you're either looking to hire me as a developer for your next project,<br>
				or you're here because you stomped upon my resume and this link was in it.</p>
			<p>Either way- I'm glad you found me and took the time to read it all up to this dot.<br>
				I hope we make great thing together!</p>
