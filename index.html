					  <h2>Why Am I Here?</h2>
						<p>Well, that's a great question, to be honest. <br>
						I definitely didn't think writing code and testing it a hundred times <br>
						before it finally worked the way I wanted- <br>was gonna be what I do for a living.</p>
						<p>Yet, here I am. Loving every second of it.</p>

						<h2>Why Are You Here?</h2>
						<p>Wild guess- you're either looking to hire me as a developer for your next project,<br>
						or you're here because you stomped upon my resume and this link was in it.</p>
						<p>Either way- I'm glad you found me <br>and took the time to read it all up to this dot.</p>
						<h3>I hope we make great things together!</h3>
